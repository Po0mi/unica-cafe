# Unica's Cafe — Official Website

> *"Where every cup feels like home."*

A warm, editorial-style cafe website built for **Unica's Cafe** in Cabatuan, Iloilo, Philippines. Designed with a shibui-inspired aesthetic — restraint, intentionality, and quiet elegance — using oversized typography, a terracotta palette, and smooth GSAP animations.

## Design System

### Colors

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `#968d7e` | All section backgrounds |
| Terracotta | `#9d6b53` | Primary text, borders, accents |
| Transparent | `transparent` | Outlined text stroke |

### Typography

| Font | Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Playfair Display | 400, 700, 700 Italic | Headings, hero, contact title |
| Funnel Sans | 300, 400, 500 | Body text, labels, UI elements |

### Easing

All transitions use a single custom ease for consistency:

```js
CustomEase.create("main", "0.65, 0.01, 0.05, 0.99");
```

### Texture

A `cement-texture.jpg` overlay is applied at `opacity: 0.2` with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` across all sections to give the site its tactile, printed quality.

---

## Components

### Navbar
Fixed navigation with active section tracking via `useActiveSection`. Desktop shows a right-aligned vertical link list. Mobile shows a minimal dropdown that animates with GSAP.

### Hero
Full-viewport section with oversized "Unica's Cafe" title, a floating coffee cup image, tagline, and an "Explore Menu" CTA. The cup spans into the About section for visual continuity.

### About
Left-aligned description text, a customer blockquote, and a giant outlined "About" title as a background watermark. Features the `ScrollLine` component — an SVG path that draws itself on scroll and fades out at the end of the section.

### Menu
Three accordion categories — Beverages, Food, and Croffles — with subcategory grids, dotted leader lines between item names and prices, and column headers for Hot/Iced and Single/Overload pricing variants.

### Gallery
Horizontal drag-to-scroll strip with varying card widths (tall, wide, square), a live progress bar counter, a custom terracotta drag cursor, and hover overlays revealing the category label and italic title.

### Contact
Conversational fill-in-the-blank form that reads as a natural sentence. Inputs grow dynamically as the user types. Includes cafe info, a sweep-animation send button, and a site footer.

### ScrollLine
SVG path drawn via `strokeDashoffset` animation tied to scroll progress through the About section. Fades out when the section ends so it doesn't bleed into the Menu.

## Custom Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `useToggle` | Boolean open/close state with toggle and close helpers |
| `useClickOutside` | Fires a callback when a click occurs outside a ref element |
| `useScrollPosition` | Returns current window scroll Y position |
| `useActiveSection` | Tracks which section ID is currently in the viewport |

---

This site can be deployed to:

- **Vercel** — `npm run build` then drag `/dist` into Vercel dashboard, or connect the GitHub repo
- **Netlify** — same process, set build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `dist`
